December 2013 - RUBY ON RAILS APP WRITTEN BY ASH 

This app was created to help analysts automate their report generating. An Analyst would generate source data from vendor's application in the form of excel files. He/She would upload these files into the app. The app would clean the data, normalize it. 2 algorithms make the crux of the app. 

1) Normalizes the beginning and end times of programs that run between 2 days or on a 24 hour clock
2) Assigns a time slot label to each program slot so that it can be displayed on a gantt chart in the visualization
